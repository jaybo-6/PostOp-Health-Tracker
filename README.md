# post_op

This app aims to track a patient's health parameters, such as blood pressure, blood sugar level, spO2 level, etc., which are required to be monitored over a period of time post-surgery.
Built with a simple Flutter UI, the app will allow individuals to digitize their health data with ease and accuracy.
The key point is that patients will be able to share this vital information with their healthcare providers, enabling them to monitor their progress remotely and make informed decisions about their care. The app will help keep track of their vitals and not only improve patient outcomes but also provide healthcare professionals with valuable data to enhance their understanding of post-surgical recovery.
The methodologies and tools used to make the app are Flutter, Android Studio, the Dart programming language, and SQLite.
Results and Conclusion: In conclusion, the app designed to track post-surgery vitals is a game-changer in the healthcare industry. It provides a convenient and reliable way for patients to monitor their health after medical procedures while also providing healthcare professionals with valuable data to improve patient care. With the ability to track vital signs accurately, patients can take charge of their recovery and work closely with their healthcare providers towards a successful outcome. The app is a prime example of how technology can be used to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of care in the medical field.
